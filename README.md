# RoSP Task Planner

This repository contains PDDL files and documentation for modeling a task planning domain for **RoSP** (Robot Supporting Parents), a robotic assistant designed to help parents manage daily routines. The project is developed as part of an AI planning assignment, using the **Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

**RoSP** is a conceptual intelligent agent that supports household tasks. Using PDDL, we define:
- The **Domain File**: Specifies the actions, predicates, and types.
- The **Problem File**: Specifies the initial state and goal conditions for a specific task instance.
