# RoSP Task Planner

This repository contains PDDL files and documentation for modeling a task planning domain for **RoSP** (Robot Supporting Parents), a robotic assistant designed to help parents manage daily routines. The project is developed as part of an AI planning assignment, using the **Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)**.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

**RoSP** is a conceptual intelligent agent that supports household tasks. Using PDDL, we define:
- The **Domain File**: Specifies the actions, predicates, and types.
- The **Problem File**: Specifies the initial state and goal conditions for a specific task instance.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open [**PDDL Editor**](https://editor.planning.domains/)
2. Upload both `domain.pddl` and `problem.pddl`
3. Click **"Validate & Plan"** to generate a plan
4. Review the resulting action sequence

---

## âœ… Example Scenario

RoSP helps with:
- Preparing meals
- Cleaning rooms
- Assisting children
- Managing schedules

The PDDL files encode actions such as `prepare-breakfast`, `clean-room`, and `assist-homework`, allowing RoSP to create efficient action sequences based on household goals.
